To plot the bar chart I will do an aggegate count by reviewer score, then pass it into a plotly express bar chart. Since the lowest score given is a 2, I will also add scores of 0 and 1 with a count of 0. I feel this is an acceptable inclusion to the data since scores of 0 and 1 are possible, and since their count is technically zero."
